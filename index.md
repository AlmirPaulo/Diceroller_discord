## How to roll dices?

Just use the ordinary abreviations of dice rolls from the traditional RPG systems after a "!". Like this "!2d6" (without the quotes) to roll 2 six-sided dices, for example. The bot is able to roll until 9 dices each time. And the available dices are: d3, d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20 and d%. What are pretty much all the common dices in RPG games. 

Important to say, if you want to roll a single dice, you still need to add the number of dices in the command. Like this "!1d20". Otherwise the bot will not understand you. You know... machines...
